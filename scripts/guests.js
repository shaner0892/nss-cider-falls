//you will need to import the copy of guests and parkAreas from database.js and assign it to a variable



//add a click event for when the guest's name is clicked it displays what parkArea they are in
    //you will need a for...of loop that iterates through the guests
        //an if statement to check id's match
            //invoke the function that determines parkArea for each guest, pass in the guests as a parameter
            //use string interpolation to print window alert



//create and export a function that iterates through the guests and prints first and last name in HTML/list format to the DOM
    //needs no parameters and a for...of loop
        //returns HTML string
